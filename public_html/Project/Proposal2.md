Milestone Features:
	Milestone 2:
- [ ] dd/mm/yyyyPick a simple game to implement, anything that generates a score that’s more advanced than a simple random number generator (may build off of a sample from the site shared in class)
- What game will you be doing?
- [game]
- Briefly describe it.
- [describe]
Note: For this milestone the game doesn’t need to be complete, just have something basic or a placeholder that can generate a score when played.
- [ ] dd/mm/yyyyThe system will save the user’s score at the end of the game if the user is logged in
  - [ ] There should be a scores table (id, user_id, score, created)
  - [ ] Each received score is a new entry (scores will not be updated)
- [ ] dd/mm/yyyyThe user will be able to see their last 10 scores
- Show on their profile page
- Ordered by most recent
- [ ] dd/mm/yyyy Create functions that output the following scoreboards (this will be used later)
-[ ] Top 10 Weekly
- [ ] Top 10 Monthly
- [ ] Top 10 Lifetime
- [ ] Scoreboards should show no more than 10 results; if there are no results a proper message should be displayed (i.e., “No [time period] scores to display”)
